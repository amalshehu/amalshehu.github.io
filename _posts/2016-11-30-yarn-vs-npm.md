### Is Yarn better than npm?
I've been progressing on my way through angular2 and TypeScript,The package management was very important.
The angular2 team recommends the npm package manager for managing development libraries.And also npm is the default
package manager for JavaScript runtime environment nodeJs,everybody knows that.In npm there will be JSON format file,that will help to
install packages on main npm registry.The npm can manage local packages for a specific project and also globally installed JS tools.
But the npm seemed to be too slow while installing packages and no offline mode.So i thought about other dependency managers.I tried Yarn.
This comes with a lot features like Offline Mode, Network perfomance, Multiple registries, Flat mode, etc.
